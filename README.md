# School District Analysis

## Overview
I was tasked with putting together a district summary of high school metrics including student grades on math and reading, school budgets and pass/fail percentages.

## Results
1) The updated district summary shows a minimal drop in the students' average math score and no difference in the average reading score. The passing percentage in both math and reading dropped less than a single percent. The change in overall percentage of students that passed both math and reading is almost negligible (o.1%).

Initial District Summary:

Modified District Summary with 9th Grade Scores Replaced:

2) Because Thomas High School was the only school impacted by the replaced scores, the majority of the school summary was left unchanged. Thomas's math and reading scores both lessened by less than a tenth of a percent.

3) Replacing ninth graders math and reading scores at Thomas High School barely affected the overall scores. THS remained in second place in the district.

Some notes:
* Math and reading scores by grade didn't change; only 9th graders' grades were replaced, so 10th-12th graders remained the same.
* Changes to scores by school spending, size and school type were neglible.

## Summary
School district analysis was affected in the following ways:
1) The student average math score dropped by 0.1%.
2) The percentage of students who passed math dropped by 0.2%.
3) The percentage of students who passed reading dropped by 0.3%.
4) The percent change of students that passed both math and reading is 0.1%.
