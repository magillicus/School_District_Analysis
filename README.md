# School District Analysis

## Overview
I was tasked with putting together a district summary of high school metrics including student grades on math and reading, school budgets and pass/fail percentages.

## Results
1) The district summary showed that passing percentages dropped to less of a degree than the school's passing percentages.
2) The school summary had a significant drop in passing percentages.
3) Replacing ninth graders math and reading scores at Thomas High School lessened the overall school's performance relative to other schools.

Some notes:
* Math and reading scores dropped overall with the replacement of ninth graders' grades.
* School spending figures increased.
* Scores by school size decreased.
* District schools scores improved with replaced grades for ninth graders, and charter schools were unaffected.

## Summary
It appears that ninth grade math and reading scores were tampered with. When their scores were replaced, overall grade averages in both math and reading courses dropped.
School district analysis was affected in the following ways:
1) Overall Passing Percentage decreased
2) The overall number of students who passed math decreased
3) The overall number of students who passed reading decreased
4) Passing percentages for math and reading decreased
